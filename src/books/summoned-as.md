title: Summoned as [Error #46]
description: |
    Join Mark in his fight against a God and change the game's destiny!
    
    Delve into a slow-paced story focused on the progression of the main party and the development of the world. Mark himself will be narrating his life inside the game, and to a much lesser extend outside. Guild building, economy, and strategy are the central pieces of the novel. 
    
    Mark is not overpowered, he will have to build his own power through action-packed battles, trials, traumas, love, and death. Accompany him, the healer and the strategist, an agent of chaos, in the adventure of his life. 
    
    Without further preamble, I will let Mark take the mic.
